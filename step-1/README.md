# PSSNet: **P**lanarity-sensible **S**emantic **S**egmentation of Large-scale Urban Meshes (Step-1).

This is part of the implementation of the paper: [*PSSNet: Planarity-sensible Semantic Segmentation of Large-scale Urban Meshes*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622003355). 
Specifically, it is used for *Step-1*: planarity-sensible over-segmentation.   
It is based on the implementation of [*SUM: Planarity-sensible Semantic Segmentation of Large-scale Urban Meshes*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622003355), which is an open-source program for automatic semantic segmentation of large-scale urban texture meshes.
It is mainly implemented in C++ with other open-source libraries, such as [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) and [Easy3D](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D).

## Usage
The program is currently only supported to run and compile on **Windows (10 or 11)** system.
To use this program on other operating systems, the source code will need to be modified and updated.
If you would like to contribute to this project, please contact the author.

### Data organization
For the organization of the data in the folders, please refer to the [demo data](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/opendata/sum/1.0/data_demo_pssnet/).

For the structure of `*.ply` data, we have added the following additional items.

|    names                 |    ply types      |    data types     |    description                                                      |
| :----------------------: |  :--------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
| label                    | comment           | -                 | label definition, e.g., `comment label 1 ground`                  |
| label                    | property (face)   | int               | label stored at each facet                                          | 
| face_segment_id          | property (face)   | int               | segment id stored at each facet                                     |
| label_probabilities      | property (face)   | float             | probabilities stored at each facet                                  |
| segment_xxx_features_xxx | property (face)   | float             | features stored at each facet for visualization as scalar field     |
| segment_xxx_features_xxx | property (vertex) | list uint32 float | features stored at each vertex as intermediate data for computation |

### Data requirements
For the **format** of input meshes, the current program only support [`*.ply`](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/) 
format triangular meshes and `*.jpg` format textures, and each mesh file must have associated textures. 
For the mesh **topologies**, we only support manifold meshes.
For the **size** of mesh tiles, each tile should be larger than 50 x 50 m.  

### Running the code
Before you run the program, make sure that your input data meet the requirements and that you have configured `config.txt`.
You can refer to the [demo data](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/opendata/sum/1.0/data_demo_pssnet/) to check how to prepare the configuration file.
Besides, you need to install [`Python (>=3.7)`](https://www.python.org/), [`imbalanced-learn`](https://imbalanced-learn.org/), and [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), and replace the `..\Python\Python37\Lib\site-packages\imblearn\over_sampling\_smote\filter.py` with provided `..\3rd_party\python_parsing\py_aug\filter.py`.
You could run the code as follows: 
```
.\semantic_urban_mesh_segmentation.exe [path to config.txt. For example, if your config.txt is saved in "C:\data\", you need to use "C:\data\" as the parameter]
```
The generated graphs and point clouds are stored in ```.\data_demo\PSSNet\spg_input\graph_edges``` and ```.\data_demo\PSSNet\spg_input\pcl``` respectively. After obtaining the predictions from [*Step-2*](https://github.com/WeixiaoGao/PSSNet), simply copy the predictions into ```.\data_demo\PSSNet\spg_output\```, and run the *Evaluation_SOTA* mode. The parsed semantic mesh will be saved in the ```.\data_demo\PSSNet\spg_output\```, and evaluation results will be saved in ```.\data_demo\PSSNet\evaluation```.

### Operation modes for PSSNet
* **PSSNet_pipeline_for_GCN**: Run the following modes in sequence: *Get_labels_for_planar_non_planar_from_semantic*, *Pipeline*, *PSSNet_oversegmentation*, *PSSNet_oversegmentation_evaluation,* *PSSNet_graph_construction*, and *PSSNet_pcl_generation_for_GCN*.
* **Get_labels_for_planar_non_planar_from_semantic**: Use the label map defined in ```L1_to_L0_label_map``` to generate planar and non-planar ground truth meshes.
* **Pipeline**: Run the following modes in sequence: Mesh_feature_extraction, Train_and_Test_config, and Data_evaluation_for_all_tiles_config.
* **PSSNet_oversegmentation**: Performing over-segmentation of PSSNet by using geometric features and priors from planar and non-planar classifications.
* **PSSNet_oversegmentation_evaluation**: Evaluation of the mesh over-segmentation results according to the metric proposed in the paper. 
* **PSSNet_graph_construction**: Use the proposed four types of edges to construct the input graph for the GCN.
* **PSSNet_pcl_generation_for_GCN**: Generate a point cloud consisting of mesh vertices and face centers with hand-crafted features as input to the GCN.
* **Evaluation_SOTA**: Transferring the semantic labels from point clouds to mesh triangles and evaluating the results for PSSNet.
